        tweetstream - Simple twitter streaming API

        Introduction
        ------------
        
        tweetstream provides a class, TweetStream, that can be used to get
        tweets from Twitter's streaming API. An instance of the class can be used as
        an iterator. In addition to fetching tweets, the object keeps track of
        the number of tweets collected and the rate at which tweets are received.
        
        Subclasses are available for accessing the "track" and "follow" streams
        as well.
        
        There's also a ReconnectingTweetStream class that handles automatic
        reconnecting.
        
        Twitter's documentation about the streaming API can be found here:
        http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation .
        
        **Note** that the API is blocking. If for some reason data is not immediatly
        available, calls will block until enough data is available to yield a tweet.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Printing all incomming tweets:
        
        >>> stream = tweetstream.TweetStream("username", "password")
        >>> for tweet in stream:
        ...     print tweet
        
        
        The stream object can also be used as a context, as in this example that
        prints the author for each tweet as well as the tweet count and rate:
        
        >>> with tweetstream.TweetStream("username", "password") as stream
        ...     for tweet in stream:
        ...         print "Got tweet from %-16s\t( tweet %d, rate %.1f tweets/sec)" % (
        ...                 tweet["user"]["screen_name"], stream.count, stream.rate )
        
        
        Stream objects can raise ConnectionError or AuthenticationError exceptions:
        
        >>> try:
        ...     with tweetstream.TweetStream("username", "password") as stream
        ...         for tweet in stream:
        ...             print "Got tweet from %-16s\t( tweet %d, rate %.1f tweets/sec)" % (
        ...                     tweet["user"]["screen_name"], stream.count, stream.rate )
        ... except tweetstream.ConnectionError, e:
        ...     print "Disconnected from twitter. Reason:", e.reason
        
        To get tweets that relate to specific terms, use the TrackStream:
        
        >>> words = ["opera", "firefox", "safari"]
        >>> with tweetstream.TrackStream("username", "password", words) as stream
        ...     for tweet in stream:
        ...         print "Got interesting tweet:", tweet
        
        To get only tweets from a set of users, use the FollowStream. The following
        would get tweets for user 1, 42 and 8675309
        
        >>> users = [1, 42, 8675309]
        >>> with tweetstream.FollowStream("username", "password", users) as stream
        ...     for tweet in stream:
        ...         print "Got  tweet from:", tweet["user"]["screen_name"]
        
        
        Simple tweet fetcher that sends tweets to an AMQP message server using carrot:
        
        >>> from carrot.messaging import Publisher
        >>> from carrot.connection import AMQPConnection
        >>> from tweetstream import TweetStream
        >>> amqpconn = AMQPConnection(hostname="localhost", port=5672,
        ...                           userid="test", password="test",
        ...                           vhost="test")
        >>> publisher = Publisher(connection=amqpconn,
        ...                       exchange="tweets", routing_key="stream")
        >>> with TweetStream("username", "password") as stream:
        ...    for tweet in stream:
        ...        publisher.send(tweet)
        >>> publisher.close()
